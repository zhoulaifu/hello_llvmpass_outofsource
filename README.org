* A minimal working example for building an LLVM pass

This repo attempts to provide a starting point for writing and
building an LLVM pass. To make things as simple as possible, the code
is to be built with bare-bone command lines, and the piece of code for
the LLVM pass is to be put out of the LLVM source tree.

** Assume we have an LLVM bitcode built with Clang.

clang++ -emit-llvm main_tested.cpp -o main_tested.bc

** How to build the LLVM pass into a shared library

 g++ -c Hello.cpp -fPIC `llvm-config --cppflags` -fno-rtti &&  g++ Hello.o -shared

** How to run the pass

 opt -load ./a.out -hello < main_tested.bc  > /dev/null
