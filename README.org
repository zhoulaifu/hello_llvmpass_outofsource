* A minimal working example of an LLVM pass, built a la out-of-source, without CMake

This repo attempts to provide a starting point for writing an
LLVM pass. To make things as simple as possible, the code is to be
built with several command lines, out of the LLVM source tree.

** How to build the pass

1. Comple the target into LLVM bitcode; Clang is needed in this step

clang++ -emit-llvm main_tested.cpp -o main_tested.bc

2. Compile the LLVM pass 

 g++ -c Hello.cpp -fPIC `llvm-config --cppflags` -fno-rtti

3. Build into the shared library

 g++ Hello.o -shared

** How to run the pass

 opt -load ./a.out -hello < main_tested.bc  > /dev/null
